# Introduction

### Brief
Inner Balance is a visually calming and accessible single page website built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to promote mindfulness and mental well-being.






### Key Objectives
-	Provide concise meditation guides for beginners and experienced practitioners.
-	Create a soothing visual atmosphere to encourage relaxation.
-	Ensure mobile responsiveness for seamless user experience across devices.
-	Utilize Bootstrap components for structured and engaging design.

## UX/UI Design

<li>As a user, I want a structured footer with a section for mental health support with links so that I can find external resources for further help.
<li>As a user, I want accessible content with clear content and contrast so that I can read comfortably without strain.
<li>As a user, I want a meditation technique section with simple explanations so that I can easily understand and practice new methods.
<li>As a user, I want a breathwork technique section with simple explanations so that I can easily understand and practice new methods.

 #### Should Haves:

<li>As a user, I want soft hover effects on interactive elements so that the experience feels more intuitive and polished.
<li>As a user, I want a colour-customizable UI so that I can choose between a warm and cool colour scheme.

#### Could Haves:

<li>As a user, I want an interactive breathing graphic so that I can do a breathing exercise whilst following alongside the animation.
<li>As a user, I want a meditation playlist suggestion section so that I can listen to calming music while meditating.


### Wireframes

Balsamiq was used to design the wireframes and to outline the key outline of the features across 3 device sizes; small screen, medium screens and large screens.

# Assessment Criteria & Post Project Reflections

LO1: Learners will be able to design and implement a one-page interactive front-end web application using HTML and CSS based on user experience design principles, accessibility, and responsiveness.
| Criterion               | Assessment Criteria         | Expected Performance | Personal Reflection |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------|----------------------------- |
| 1.1 Front-End Design        | Design a cohesive one-page layout with a main navigation menu and structured content. Ensure the design adheres to accessibility guidelines, including appropriate colour contrast and alt text for non-text elements. Utilise CSS or CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap to create a responsive design.  | A cohesive one-page layout with a main navigation menu and structured content. Semantic use of HTML. Adherence to accessibility guidelines (colour contrast, alt text). No Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG) errors. The layout adapts to different screen sizes using CSS media queries, Flexbox, Grid, and/or Bootstrap without any major errors/loss of functionality.                              |  
| 1.2 User Experience       | Organise information using UX principles ensuring headers convey structure and information is easy to find. Ensure the user can initiate and control actions such as playing media (if included) with immediate feedback.  | Information organised using UX principles (clear headers, prioritised information). User-initiated actions (if chosen) with immediate feedback (e.g., media control).                             | 

LO2: Learners will be able to test and validate the one-page web application through the development, implementation, and deployment stages.
| Criterion               | Assessment Criteria         | Expected Performance | Personal Reflection |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------|----------------------------- |
| 2.1 Code Validation       | Ensure custom HTML and CSS pass W3C and Jigsaw validators with no issues. | HTML and CSS code passing W3C and Jigsaw validators with no issues.|  
| 2.2 Responsive Design       | Use CSS media queries to ensure the layout is responsive and maintains integrity across different screen sizes. Apply semantic markup for HTML to enhance readability and structure. Ensure the single page features intuitive navigation.| Consistent layout across different screen sizes due to CSS media queries. Clear and semantic HTML structure. Intuitive, functional navigation on the single page.                   | 


LO3: Learners will be able to deploy the one-page web application to a cloud platform.
